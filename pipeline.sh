# Step 1: Quality Control for FAIRE-seq Data
mkdir -p qc_reports
fastqc -o qc_reports/ *.fastq

# Step 2: Read Alignment for FAIRE-seq Data
bwa index reference_genome.fa
bwa mem -t 4 reference_genome.fa sample1.fastq sample2.fastq > aligned_reads.sam
samtools view -bS aligned_reads.sam | samtools sort -o aligned_reads.bam
samtools index aligned_reads.bam

# Step 3: Filtering of Aligned Reads
# Remove PCR duplicates and low-quality reads
samtools rmdup aligned_reads.bam filtered_reads.bam
samtools view -q 30 -b filtered_reads.bam > high_quality_reads.bam

# Step 4: Peak Calling for FAIRE-seq Data
macs2 callpeak -t high_quality_reads.bam -n peaks --outdir peaks/ -f BAMPE -g hs

# Step 5: Annotation of Peaks
annotatePeaks.pl peaks/peaks.narrowPeak hg38 > annotated_peaks.txt

# Step 6: Differential Accessibility Analysis (Optional)
# Perform if comparing between different experimental conditions
# Example using DESeq2
Rscript run_deseq2.R peaks/peaks.narrowPeak sample_info.txt

# Step 7: Functional Enrichment Analysis
# Perform functional enrichment analysis of accessible regions using external tools
# Example using GREAT
# Example command: great analysis peaks/peaks.narrowPeak hg38

# Step 8: Motif Analysis (Optional)
# Identify enriched sequence motifs within accessible regions
# Example using MEME-ChIP
# Example command: meme-chip -meme-maxw 20 -meme-minw 6 -oc meme_output -db motif_database peaks/peaks.narrowPeak

# Step 9: Visualization and Interpretation
# Visualize and interpret the identified accessible regions, differential accessibility, and enriched motifs
